## How to use
+ Use the toolbar to create new widget
+ Move them around with click and drag
+ Create new connection by click and dragging from a connector to either nothing or another connector
+ Turn on and off inputs by clicking on them

When creating new connections, the software automatically handles loop detection, and will prevent you from creating one
